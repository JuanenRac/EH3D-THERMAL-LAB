### EH3D-THERMAL-LAB: stage-1 thermal estimates: the heating of a copper trace and simplified thermal networks, where every result states its hypotheses, conditions and limits. Early code.

**Honesty check - what actually runs today:** a Rust library and a command line that compute the temperature rise of a copper trace that carries a current (Joule effect, with the resistance growing with the temperature, cooled by convection) and across a network of thermal resistances in series and parallel. A result is only accepted with its hypotheses, boundary conditions, materials, uncertainty, limitations and range of validity; a case that gets too hot or does not converge gives no number. All of it has run only on cases made by its own tests and compared with closed-form values; nothing was compared with a solver or a measurement. What does not exist: the use of losses from the simulation domain, the coupling with the mechanical geometry and the comparison with measurements.

> **Safety and security status:** this repository is at its first steps and is not a safety system. Nothing written here replaces the limits, interlocks and emergency stop of the machine and its controller.

## 🚦 Project status

Each line is one part of this repository and the light says how far it is today. It is written from what the repository can show (tests, builds, runs), not from what is planned.

🟢 Done and verified · 🟡 Works, with known limits · 🟠 Partly done or not verified yet · 🔴 Not done or not working

| Area | State | What it means here |
|---|---|---|
| Repository checks | 🟡 | The repository check, the check of the pictures and the 3 tests of the base run in CI and pass. |
| Tests | 🟡 | 21 tests of the Rust code and the 3 of the base pass on a computer. They use only cases made by the tests themselves and closed-form values. |
| Real hardware | 🟠 | Not run on any machine or board: nothing here has been tried on hardware. |
| Planned function | 🟠 | Written: the Joule heating of a trace, the series and parallel network, the result that refuses to exist without its conditions and the refusal of cases out of range or without convergence. Not written: heat sources from the simulation domain, the geometry of the mechanical tool and the comparison with measurements. |
| Requirements | 🟠 | 4 of the 7 requirements are at prototype; the heat sources, the coupling with the geometry and the comparison with measurements are only planned. None is validated. |

## 🎯 Overview

* **What exists:** a library and a command line, without a window, that compute the heating of a trace (`trace`), the rise across a thermal network (`network`) and check that a result carries all its conditions (`check`). **Planned:** heat sources from the simulation domain, the coupling with the geometry and the comparison with measurements.

## 🧩 Role in EH3D

EH3D-THERMAL-LAB is part of the PHOENIX family of the EH3D Fabrication Suite. What it will do, what it will not do yet, its requirements and its relations with other repositories are written in the `docs/` folder.

## 🏛️ Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/architecture.svg" alt="EH3D-THERMAL-LAB architecture: who uses it, what it holds and what it depends on" width="100%">
</p>

How the parts of this repository fit together: who uses it, what it holds and what it depends on. The picture is drawn from `docs/architecture.json` and checked against the code.

## 🚀 Quick start

You need Python 3.10 or newer; there is nothing to install.

```bash
python -I tools/ci_validate.py
python -I tools/make_architecture.py --check
python -I tools/make_structure.py --check --readmes
python -I -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py"
```

## 🧪 Testing

The base has 3 tests (`python -I -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py"`), and they pass. The CI runs the repository check, the check of the pictures and those tests.

## 🏗️ Build & Release

The version lives in the `VERSION` file and in `eh3d.project.json`, and each version has its entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). There is nothing to build; releases are published on GitHub.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Known limits

**Known limits today**

* Early code: every result is an estimate that has not been compared with a solver or a measurement, and its uncertainty is a placeholder set in the settings.

**Next**

* Wait until the contracts this project depends on are accepted (see `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`), then write the first version with tests and replace the status rows with real results.

## 🌍 Languages

README and texts exist in English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Japanese and European Portuguese.
